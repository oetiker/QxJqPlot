Known Bugs
----------

* There seem to be issues with mouse interaction. Plugins highlit and
  dragable do not work and the cursor plugins zoom functionality
  only works when draging the mouse outside the chart canvas.
 
  Since the official examples do work, I guess there is some unfortunate
  interaction with the qooxdoo event system.
